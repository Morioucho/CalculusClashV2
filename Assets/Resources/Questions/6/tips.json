    "Recognize a separable differential equation by identifying whether the equation can be rewritten so all y-terms are on one side and all x-terms on the other.",
    "Always include a constant of integration C when solving a general solution to a differential equation, unless you’re solving an initial value problem.",
    "Use the initial condition to solve for C after integrating, so you can find the particular solution to a differential equation.",
    "Use slope fields to visualize solutions to differential equations and to match them with a given differential equation.",
    "Be able to interpret the meaning of terms in a logistic model, such as how the growth slows as y approaches the carrying capacity",
    "Check your integration work carefully when solving differential equations — common errors include incorrect antiderivatives and forgetting absolute value signs in natural logs.",
    "Understand the real-world meaning of logistic growth, especially in AP free response questions where you must interpret behavior like stabilization, maximum growth rate, or long-term limits.",
    "Check your integration work carefully when solving differential equations — common errors include incorrect antiderivatives and forgetting absolute value signs in natural logs.",
    "Understand that a differential equation models a rate of change, so interpreting context (like population or velocity) is often key on the AP exam.",
    "Label your differential equation clearly when answering free-response questions, especially when solving or modeling — it shows your understanding of the setup."
