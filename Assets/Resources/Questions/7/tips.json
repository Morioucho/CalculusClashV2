    "Understand how to convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates when analyzing curves or setting up integrals.",
    "Be careful with symmetry in polar graphs; test for symmetry about the x-axis, y-axis, or origin to simplify your sketching or integration.",
    "Use a calculator to trace parametric and polar graphs, especially for complex functions, to better visualize motion and areas — this is allowed on the AP exam and can save time.",
    "Pay attention to the bounds of t or theta when setting up integrals, as incorrect bounds are a common source of mistakes in parametric and polar problems.",
    "When analyzing motion in parametric form, positive and negative values of dx/dt and dy/dt indicate direction, so it’s important to understand velocity components.",
    "Polar area problems often involve sectors that overlap, so carefully check the range of theta and whether you need to subtract or add areas from multiple curves.",
    "Know that polar coordinates are not unique, meaning the same point can have multiple representations which can affect interpretation and area calculations.",
    "To find horizontal and vertical tangents on a parametric curve, set dy/dt=0 and dx/dt=0 respectively, and ensure the denominator in dy/dx is not zero.",
    "Understand that a parametric curve can pass through the same point multiple times, so check the values of x(t) & y(t) carefully at different t values when solving for intersections.",
    "When finding the intersection points of polar graphs, equate both curves to each other, but also check graphically or plug values into both equations since polar curves can intersect in non-obvious ways."
