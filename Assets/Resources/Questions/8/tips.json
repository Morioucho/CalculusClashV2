    "Familiarize yourself with common series types, such as geometric, p-series, harmonic, telescoping, and alternating series, since recognizing them quickly helps determine convergence.",
    "Memorize the convergence tests, including the Ratio Test, Root Test, Integral Test, Comparison Tests, and Alternating Series Test, as they are crucial tools for analyzing infinite series.",
    "Understand how to apply the Ratio Test, especially for power series and factorials, because it is often the most efficient test for convergence in AP problems.",
    "Practice finding the interval and radius of convergence for power series using the Ratio Test, and remember to check endpoints separately for absolute or conditional convergence.",
    "Learn the formula for the sum of a geometric series.",
    "Get comfortable with Taylor and Maclaurin series, including their general form and the first few standard expansions.",
    "Use Taylor's Remainder Theorem to estimate the error of a Taylor polynomial approximation when asked for bounds or error terms.",
    "Work through multiple AP-style problems involving series, including those that ask for convergence, divergence, and function approximation, to build speed and confidence."
