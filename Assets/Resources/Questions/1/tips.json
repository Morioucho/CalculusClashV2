    "To evaluate a limit, try direct substitution first.",
    "If direct substitution gives 0/0, factor and simplify before re-evaluating.",
    "Use L'Hôpital's Rule for indeterminate forms like 0/0 or ∞/∞.",
    "Remember the definition of the derivative as a limit.",
    "For continuity, check that the function is defined, the limit exists, and both are equal at the point.",
    "Know the difference between removable and non-removable discontinuities.",
    "A function is continuous at a point if the left and right limits exist and are equal to the function value.",
    "Piecewise functions may require checking limits from both sides at break points.",
    "A removable discontinuity occurs when a limit exists but the function is not defined at that point.",
    "A jump discontinuity occurs when the left and right limits are not equal."
