    "Understand the basic polar graph shapes such as circles, limacons, cardioids, and roses.",
    "Convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates using x = r*cos(θ) and y = r*sin(θ).",
    "To find symmetry, test for polar axis, line θ = π/2, and origin symmetry using transformations.",
    "Graph key points at standard angles (like 0, π/6, π/4, π/2, etc.).",
    "For r = f(θ), remember that negative r means the point is in the opposite direction (add π to θ).",
    "Eliminate the parameter to convert to Cartesian form if needed.",
    "Use derivatives dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) to find slopes of tangents.",
    "Check dx/dt and dy/dt to find where the curve has horizontal or vertical tangents.",
    "Graph x(t) and y(t) separately against t to understand the motion.",
    "Parameterize curves to model real-world motion (e.g., projectile motion, circular paths).",
    "Draw a diagram and label all variables clearly.",
    "Write the objective function you want to maximize or minimize.",
    "Use constraints to reduce the objective function to a single variable.",
    "Take the derivative and find critical points to identify maxima or minima.",
    "Check endpoints and critical points for absolute extrema, especially on closed intervals."
