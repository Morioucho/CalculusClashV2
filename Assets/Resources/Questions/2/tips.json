    "Familiarize yourself with the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. These are the building blocks for most derivative problems.",
    "Know the derivatives of basic functions like polynomials, sine, cosine, exponential, and logarithmic functions.",
    "If a function is nested (e.g., sin(x^2)), apply the chain rule by taking the derivative of the outer function and multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function.",
    "Algebraically simplify expressions before taking the derivative to make calculations easier.",
    "When y is defined implicitly as a function of x, differentiate both sides of the equation and use dy/dx where needed.",
    "Use proper notation (like d/dx or dy/dx) and label each step to reduce errors and make reviewing easier.",
    "Understand how the derivative relates to the slope of the tangent line. For example, if a function is increasing, its derivative should be positive.",
    "Real-world problems involving rates of change (like velocity or growth) often use derivatives, so practice applying the concepts."
